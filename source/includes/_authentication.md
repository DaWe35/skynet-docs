# API Authentication

Portals will likely require authentication on several of their endpoints. This is to prevent unwanted modifications to the blocklist, portal list, etc.

If you are authorized to use password-protected endpoints on a portal, you may authenticate yourself by setting the `APIKey` custom option when calling a function.

For more information about authentication on portals please see [the Sia Docs](https://sia.tech/docs/#authentication).
